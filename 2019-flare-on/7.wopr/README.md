## Solution

把binary打開後，發現Pyinstaller的字樣，猜測是python寫的，
因此解開來看看，解開的方法可以參考我的[github.io](https://zondatw.github.io/2019/pyinstaller_decompile/)  

| package     | version |

| PyInstaller | 3.5     |

λ python pyinstxtractor.py wopr.exe

You can now use a python decompiler on the pyc files within the extracted directory
```

依據以前的經驗主要檔案會是第二個entry point，所以針對pyiboot02_cleanup進行分析。  
再來有點不一樣，不知道是不是因為是3.7的緣故，patch的東西有點不一樣，剛開始用舊方法一直沒辦法decompiler，後來試著用struct的格式就成功了。

Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary,

But the silence was unbroken, and the stillness gave no token,

On the pallid bust of Pallas just above my chamber door;                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
And his eyes have all the seeming of a demon's that is dreaming,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
And the lamp-light o'er him streaming throws his shadow on the floor;

        meaning[pigeon] ^= manage[prospect(manage[feel], manage[cassette])]

    return bytes(meaning)


for i in range(256):
    try:
        print(lzma.decompress(fire(eye(__doc__.encode()), bytes([i]) + BOUNCE)))
    except Exception:
        pass
# okay decompiling pyiboot02_cleanup.pyc
```

這段主要是將print跟exec執行的位址互調  

```python
a = 1702389091 # exec
b = 482955849332 # print
g = ho(29516388843672123817340395359, globals()) # __builtins__
aa = getattr(g, ho(a))
bb = getattr(g, ho(b))
a ^= b
b ^= a
a ^= b
setattr(g, ho(a), aa)
setattr(g, ho(b), bb)
```

直接執行是會一直出錯的，找了很久發現原因是，uncompyle6會將tab去掉，所以在下面這行code時，永遠都是1，分析這段code應該是指source code藏在空白和tab中:
```
taxi = {9:0, 
         32:1}.get(chuck)
```
後來找到一個線上的python decompiler網站([https://tool.lu/pyc](https://tool.lu/pyc))才將tab還原回來成功解出source code

首先找出wrong計算出來的值為何，分析後:

        name, tropical, inhabitant, reader, chalk, _, _, _, _, _ = struct.unpack_from('=8sIIIIIIHHI', computer, 40 * insurance + dirty + variety + 24)
        if inhabitant <= participate < inhabitant + tropical: # find first section: .text
            break

    with open("wopr.dump", "rb") as f:
        spare = bytearray(f.read()[:tropical])
    #spare = bytearray(string_at(trust + inhabitant, tropical)) # get .text
    print(spare[:100])
    print(f"AddressOfEntryPoint: {hex(participate)}")

    while expertise <= len(truth) - 8:
        nuance, seem = struct.unpack_from('=II', truth, expertise)
        print(f"VirtualAddress: {hex(nuance)}, SizeOfBlock: {hex(seem)}")
        if nuance == 0 and seem == 0:
            break

        slot = truth[expertise + 8:expertise + seem]
        print(slot)
        for i in range(len(slot) >> 1):
            diet, = struct.unpack_from('=H', slot, 2 * i)
            fabricate = diet >> 12
            if fabricate != 3: continue
            diet = diet & 4095

    return hashlib.md5(spare).digest()

xor = [212, 162, 242, 218, 101, 109, 50, 31, 125, 112, 249, 83, 55, 187, 131, 206]
h = list(wrong())
h = [h[i] ^ xor[i] for i in range(16)]
print(h)
```

他會去解析relocation table，但因為這是執行後才會配置的，所以我們要去dump memory的內容，我是採用x32dbg去做dump，  
分析過程中發現spare為.text的內容，所以就直接把.text dump出wopr.dump  
解出h為[115, 29, 32, 68, 106, 108, 89, 76, 21, 71, 78, 51, 75, 1, 55, 102]  

接下來的輸入要經過一連串的計算，這邊直接寫個z3 script做解析  

```python
from z3 import *
# http://3xp10it.cc/auxilary/2017/11/14/z3-solver学习/
#h = [14, 97, 105, 140, 73, 250, 3, 180, 198, 42, 254, 176, 219, 100, 103, 212]
h = [115, 29, 32, 68, 106, 108, 89, 76, 21, 71, 78, 51, 75, 1, 55, 102]
x = [BitVec(f"b{i}", 8) for i in range(16)]

solver = Solver()
solver.add(x[2] ^ x[3] ^ x[4] ^ x[8] ^ x[11] ^ x[14] == h[0])
